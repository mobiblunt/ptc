<h4>The Cryptvault Terms of Service</h4>
<p>Effective date: January 31, 2018</p>
<p><a href="">A. Definitions</a></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There’s not going to be a test on it, but it’s still useful information.</p> 


<p>* The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the Cryptvault Privacy Statement, available at (Cryptvault.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at our website.</p>

<p>* The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Cryptvault.</p>


<p>* The “Website” refers to Cryptvault’s website located in the UK Ireland and all content, services, and products provided by Cryptvault at or through the Website.</p>

<p>* “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See Section B(4): Additional Terms).</p>


<p>* “Cryptvault,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Cryptvault, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</p>

<p>* “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. “Content” also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Your Content” is Content that you create or own.</p>

<p><a href="">B. Account Terms</a></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</p>

<p><strong>1. Required Information</strong></p>
<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>

<p><strong>2. Account Requirements</strong></p>
<p>We have a few simple rules for accounts on Cryptvault’s Service.</p>

<p>* You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:</p>

<p>* A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine’s actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.</p>

<p>* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that’s fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</p>

<p>* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law as we are well versatile and abide by the rules of different countries jurisdictions. Cryptvaults does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</p>

<p>* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.</p>

<p>* Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you’ve ordered from us.</p>

<p><strong>3. User Account Security</strong></p>

<p>* You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account’s security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.</p>


<p>* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</p>

<p>* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Cryptvault cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>

<p>* You will promptly notify Cryptvault, if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.</p>

<p><strong>4. Additional Terms</strong></p>
<p>In some situations, third parties’ terms may apply to your use of Cryptvault. For example, you may be a member of an organization on Cryptvault with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with Cryptvault; or you may use Cryptvault to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties’ terms govern their relationships with you.</p>

<p>If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any Cryptvault Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to Cryptvault Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. If you have signed up for a Business plan, the Business Plan Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>

<p><a href="">C. Acceptable Use</a></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> Cryptvault hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.</p>

<p><strong>1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations</strong></p>
<p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>

<p><strong>2. Content Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:</p>

<p>* is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities.</p>

<p>* is or contains sexually obscene content.</p>

<p>* is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent.</p>

<p>* is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group.</p>

<p>* contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or</p>

<p>* infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.</p>


<p>* use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes.</p>

<p>* attempt to disrupt or tamper with Cryptvault’s servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on Cryptvault’s servers through automated means, or to access Cryptvault’s Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the Cryptvault’s Bug Bounty program).</p>

<p>* impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Cryptvault, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site’s purpose; or</p>

<p>* violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person’s personal information without consent.</p>

<p><strong>4. Services Usage Limits</strong></p>
<p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Cryptvault’s express written permission.</p>

<p><strong>5. Scraping</strong></p>
<p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through Cryptvault’s API. Please see Section H for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:</p>

<p>* Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from Cryptvault for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.</p>

<p>* Archivists may scrape Cryptvault for public data for archival purposes. You may not scrape Cryptvault for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Cryptvault users’ personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of Cryptvault data gathered through scraping must comply with the Cryptvault Privacy Statement.</p>



<p><strong>6. Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Misuse of Cryptvault Users’ Personal Information is prohibited.</p>

<p>Any person, entity, or service collecting data from Cryptvault must comply with the Cryptvault Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users’ Personal Information (as defined in the Cryptvault Privacy Statement). If you collect any Cryptvault User’s Personal Information from Cryptvault, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Cryptvault, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests from Cryptvault or Cryptvault Users.</p>

<p><strong>7. Excessive Bandwidth Use</strong></p>
<p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other Cryptvault customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</p>

<p><strong>8. User Protection</strong></p>
<p>You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.</p>

<p><a href="">D. User-Generated Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.</p>

<p><strong>1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</strong></p>
<p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cryptvault May Remove Content</strong></p>
<p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Cryptvault terms or policies.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</strong></p>
<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.
Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Cryptvault Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Cryptvault the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.</p>

<p><strong>4. License Grant to Us</strong></p>
<p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video. This license does not grant Cryptvault the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>

<p><strong>5. License Grant to Other Users</strong></p>
<p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control). If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Cryptvault a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Cryptvault Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Cryptvault as permitted through Cryptvault’s functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Cryptvault Users.
</p>
<p><strong>6. Contributions Under Repository License</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede. Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.
</p>
<p><strong>7. Moral Rights</strong></p>
<p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise. To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Cryptvault the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>

<p><strong>E. Private Repositories</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong>You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.</p> 

<p><strong>1. Control of Private Repositories.</strong></p>
<p>Some accounts, such as paid accounts, may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.</p>

<p><strong>2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories</strong></p>
<p>Cryptvault considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. Cryptvault will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.</p>

<p><strong>3. Access.</strong></p>
<p>Cryptvault employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:</p>
<p>* With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If Cryptvault accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.</p>
<p>* When access is required for security reasons.
You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:</p>
<p>* You may enable various Cryptvault services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but Cryptvault will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the Cryptvault Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.</p>
<p>* You may also grant a third-party application authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your private repositories. Your use of third-party applications is at your sole risk; Cryptvault is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access a private repository.</p>

<p><strong>4. Exclusions.</strong></p>
<p>If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.</p>

<p><strong>F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</strong></p>
<p>If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on Cryptvault violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@Cryptvault.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.
We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.</p>

<p><strong>G. Intellectual Property Notice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.</p>

<p><strong>1. Cryptvault’s Rights to Content</strong></p>
<p>GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © Cryptvault, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from Cryptvault.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Cryptvault’s Trademarks and Logos</strong></p>
<p>If you’d like to use Cryptvault’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://Cryptvault/logos.</p>

<p><strong>3. License to Cryptvault Policies</strong></p>
<p>This Agreement is licensed under this Creative Commons Zero license. For details, see our site-policy repository.</p>

<p><a href="">H. API Terms</a></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong>You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of Cryptvault’s APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses Cryptvault.</p> 

<p><strong>No Abuse or Overuse of the API</strong></p>
<p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Cryptvault via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Cryptvault, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.</p>
<p>You may not share API tokens to exceed Cryptvault’s rate limitations.</p>
<p>You may not use the API to download data or Content from Cryptvault for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Cryptvault users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</p>
<p>All use of the Cryptvault API is subject to these Terms of Service and the Cryptvault Privacy Statement.
Cryptvault may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of Cryptvault’s Service.</p>
<p><a href="">I. Additional Terms for Cryptvault Pages</a></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong>The Cryptvault Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms.
Each Cryptvault account comes with access to the Cryptvault Pages static hosting service. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for Cryptvault users. Cryptvault Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses. Please see our Cryptvault Pages guidelines for more information.</p> 
<p>Cryptvault reserves the right at all times to reclaim any Cryptvault subdomain without liability.</p>

<p><a href="">J. Additional Terms for Cryptvault Marketplace</a></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong>Cryptvault Marketplace is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of this Agreement.
Cryptvault marketplace is a platform for developers of all kinds. Through Cryptvault Marketplace, you can list Developer Products (as defined in the Cryptvault Marketplace Terms of Service) or buy others' Developer Products. Prior to submitting a project to be listed, you must agree to the Cryptvault Marketplace Developer Agreement.</p> 
<p>If you buy Developer Products, the Cryptvault Marketplace Terms of Service controls your purchase. This Agreement, as well as the Cryptvault Marketplace Terms of Service, will govern your use of Cryptvault Marketplace. Many of these Developer Products are used exclusively for performing automated tasks. In addition, multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your account, or you are an owner of an account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product's actions that are performed on or through your account.</p>
<p>Any violation of the Cryptvault Marketplace Terms of Service is also a violation of this Agreement.</p>

<p><a href="">K. Advertising on Cryptvault</a></p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> We do not generally prohibit use of Cryptvault for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so Cryptvault does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.</p>

<p><strong>1. Cryptvault Pages</strong></p>
<p>We offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cryptvault Repositories</strong></p>
<p>Cryptvault repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on Cryptvault.
You may not advertise in other Users' repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.</p>

You may not advertise in other Users' repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.</p>

<p><strong>3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of Cryptvault</strong></p>

<p><a href="">L. Payment</a></p>

<p><strong>1. Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Our pricing and payment terms are available at <a href="{{ route('robots.home') }}">plans</a>. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.</p>

<p><strong>2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes</strong></p>
<p>* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.</p>
<p>* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, Cryptvault will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.</p>
<p>* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.</p>
<p>* You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.</p>

<p><strong>3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds</strong></p>
<p>* For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period.</p>
<p>* In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.</p>

<p><strong>4. Authorization</strong></p>
